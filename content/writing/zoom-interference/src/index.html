<h1>zoom interference</h1>
<p class="page-intro">
    A playful exploration into the world of image rendering.
</p>
<p>
    I recently discovered that pixel interference effects can occur by zooming
    in on gray image areas. This got me thinking: Can we construct an image
    that initially looks uniformly gray but reveals information on specific
    zoom levels? Is it maybe even possible to show different grayscale images
    depending on the zoom level?
</p>
<p>
    The following tests show client-side generated images using the
    <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. However the image data is not manipulated
    during zoom - just the CSS <code>transform: scale()</code> property changes.
    The demos need pixel perfect sizes to work. Therefore the images can be too
    small or too big on some devices - I apologize.
</p>
<p>
    Please also note that I do not have any prior knowledge in the field of
    image rendering. I was just playing around and documenting things I found
    interesting. I hope you find this little tour interesting as well :).
</p>


<h2>the interference effect</h2>
<p>
    The first image is just a checkerboard pattern on pixel scale (this is
    clearly visible on <a class="demo1-checker">2x</a>). When zooming in the
    image pixel grid and the screen pixel grid are misaligned creating
    interference effects in both dimensions. They are especially strong in the
    area of
    <a class="demo1-checker">0.5x</a>,
    <a class="demo1-checker">0.25x</a>,
    <a class="demo1-checker">0.1667x</a> and
    <a class="demo1-checker">0.125x</a>.
    These turn out to be the whole number parts of 1/2. This makes sense: For
    two adjacent screen pixels the distance of the image pixels is a multiple
    of 2 which locally creates a uniformly colored area.
</p>

<p>
    Another observation about browser differences can be made here: In Chromium
    I can zoom smoothly at this microscopic scale, Firefox only allows zoom
    steps. Interestingly for every zoom step the image size is an integer
    multiple of 1/2 of the interference period. I do not know why. Also on
    Firefox for Android there are graphic glitches across the whole screen for
    some zoom levels. I guess this is a graphics driver issue of my device but
    I am not sure.
</p>
<p>
    On Chromium the image is completely black on some zoom levels like
    <a class="demo1-checker">0.5x</a>. However this bug does not occur when
    opening the image in a new tab and zooming to
    <a class="demo1-checker">0.5x</a>.
</p>
<p>
    For the second test I inverted the checkerboard pattern for some areas of
    the image. There are zoom levels like <a class="demo2-checkerinvert">1x</a>
    where just parts of the border of the shape are visible. For other zoom
    levels like <a clas="demo2-checkerinvert">0.5x</a> the whole shape area is
    clearly visible.

<h2>other types of colorings</h2>
<p>
    Let's explore some other types of local colorings. I chose uniform gray and
    random pixel values for the next demo. As expected the gray area does not
    show any interference effects at all. The random area on the other hand has
    them but they are hardly visible. You can see them if you keep the rough
    slider at <a class="demo3-grayrandom">1x</a> and just move the fine slider.
</p>
<!-- demo3-grayrandom -->
<div class="js-container">
    [If you see this text your browser unfortunately does not support
    Javascript.]
</div>
<p>
    Now let's combine different types of colorings. The random noise seems too
    different but a combination of checkerboard and gray could work. It does in
    fact: For <a class="demo4-checkergray">0.999x</a> the difference is just
    barely visible on Firefox and invisible on Chromium.
</p>
<!-- demo4-checkergray -->
<div class="js-container">
    [If you see this text your browser unfortunately does not support
    Javascript.]
</div>
<p>
    To hide the remaining interference artefacts we bring the random noise back
    and add it to our color values. Now things start to get really interesting.
    Let's just look at the zoom levels
    <a class="demo5-checkergrayrandom">0.999x</a> and
    <a class="demo5-checkergrayrandom">0.5x</a> for the next two demos.
</p>
<p>
    On <a class="demo5-checkergrayrandom">0.5x</a> the square is sometimes
    visible and sometimes invisible. After a bit of testing I found out that it
    depends on the parity of the image width. I cannot explain it but I also do
    not find it implausible that these interference effects change drastically
    on size parity.
</p>
<p>
    The real weirdness starts on <a class="demo5-checkergrayrandom">0.999x</a>.
    On Firefox the square is visible for images smaller or equal to 500px in
    size and invisible for larger ones. I suppose Firefox uses different
    rendering techniques for different image sizes. On Chrome the square is
    visible if and only if it is also visible on
    <a class="demo5-checkergrayrandom">1x</a>
    - this means visible for even image sizes and invisible for odd sizes.

<h2>invisibility on 1x</h2>
<p>
    It would be really cool to create an image that is invisible on <a>1x</a>
    but arises on zoom. This did already work but just in Chromium. My first
    idea for this was to hide the interference area in a random area and match
    the grayscale level:
</p>
<div class="js-container">
    [If you see this text your browser unfortunately does not support
    Javascript.]
</div>
<p>
    This does work on Firefox on my specific screen. The difference is however
    visible in other browsers and on Firefox on other devices.
</p>
<p>
    To create a truly invisible interference area my next idea was to rearrange
    the pixels according to their color. This ensures equal color distribution
    inside and outside the interference area. It is however rather complicated
    to implement. The same effect can be achieved with random colors using
    uneven probabilities. For a dark pixel on the checkerboard we generate two
    random color values and take the smaller one. This is equivalent to
    imagining a neighboring light pixel and swapping their values if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    Now the effect really works consistent across devices and screens! Try
    zooming to <a class="demo6-reordering">0.5x</a> for example.
</p>
<!-- demo6-reordering -->
<div class="js-container">
    [If you see this text your browser unfortunately does not support
    Javascript.]
</div>
<p>
    Now if we think in terms of probability distributions this process can be
    easily generalized from hidden black-and-white to grayscale images. Try the
    following example on <a class="demo7-reordering-grayscale">0.5x</a>
    Unfortunately the interference patterns are only clearly visible in the
    center of the image as you can see at the end of the paint brush. (This is
    sometimes not the case on Chromium.)
</p>
<!-- demo7-reordering-grayscale -->
<div class="js-container">
    [If you see this text your browser unfortunately does not support
    Javascript.]
</div>
<p>
    It would be really cool if the whole area could be used for hidden images.
    However i think that is impossible. There are always spots of destructive
    interference and for <a class"demo7-reordering-grayscale">0.5x</a> and its
    whole number parts these spots are already at the border of the image.
</p>
<p>
    Using the following file picker you can try the effect yourself. I respect
    your privacy - All images are processed client-side. (You can check that in
    the network tab in the debugging tools of your browser.
