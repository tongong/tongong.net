<h1>projects</h1>

There are two types of projects I create: solutions to problems that annoy me
and ideas I pursue out of interest.

<h2>problem-solving projects</h2>

<p>
I like JavaScript and I like building websites and web applications. But modern
JS projects seem to require hundreds of npm dependencies. This is a big mess
and a security disaster. I do not want to run the megabytes of untrusted code
web bundlers seem to need on my machine but I do want to use JS modules to keep
my projects structured. <code>tacker</code> aims to solve this by being the
most simple way of stapling files together to create self-contained pages like
to one you are currently viewing.

<p>
I was searching for a timetracking program that works in terminal and GUI and
is not completely bloated. I did not find any and wrote my own.

<h2>interesting projects</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/tongong/brainfuck-2048">brainfuck-2048</a></h3>
<p>
This is my first (and so far only) brainfuck program. The most interesting
thing about this is the random number generator.
