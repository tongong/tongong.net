<h1>about me</h1>
<h2>things i like</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I like computers. They enable wonderful new ways of expression and open
        access to incredible amounts of knowledge. But I also dislike computers
        for being drivers of social isolation and the decline of
        democracy.</li>
    <li>I like simplicity. There are rational justifications for this but I
        like it because it gives me a sense of comfort and beauty.</li>
    <li>I like programming. Besides being an extremely convenient skill it
        enables you to "create the world" as Linus Torvalds put it
        aptly.</li>
    <li>I like open-source. It captures all of the good things about
        computers.</li>
    <li>I like Unix. I think I would prefer a microkernel OS (based on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L4_microkernel_family">L4</a>
        for example) but I have not used such an OS yet.</li>
    <li>I like JS/HTML. It's the most accessible and the most portable
        programming environment available today. I dislike npm and the attached
        ecosystem (no accessibility, no portability, no simplicity).
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/">I dislike CSS.</a>
    </li>
    <li>I like C. C feels like the original way things are supposed to be.
        Learning C makes you understand computers.</li>
    <li>I like Lisp (Scheme). I have never used it though.</li>
</ul>
